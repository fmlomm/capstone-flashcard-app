# capstone-flashcard-app
This is my submission for Thinkful's capstone flash card app.
This project uses our newfound knowledge of Rendering with React, React State Management, React and APIs with hooks, and React Router to create a app that allows users 
to create and study for anything using a card and deck system.
Through CRUD operations, users can create a deck of cards for a specific topic and study using a front and back card component. Users can also access previously created
decks through our use of a database that stores the deck and card info.
